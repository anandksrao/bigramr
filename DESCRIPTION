Title: Tools to calculate unigram and bigram frequency counts of strings.

Description: This package provides tools to help calculate the Sum and Mean
    Unigram Frequencies and the Sum and Mean Bigram Frequencies of character
    strings (e.g., words, pseudowords) based on five different case-sensitive
    unigram and bigram frequency English-language corpora, collected and
    published by Jones & Mewhort (2004). The functions will also work with
    user-supplied frequency corpora, and therefore the functionality of the
    package can be immediately extended to include other frequency corpora of
    English and other languages.
